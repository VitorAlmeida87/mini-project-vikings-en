Key Programming Concepts in Your Code

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Soldier is the base class.

Viking and Saxon inherit from Soldier.

War uses composition (armies made up of objects).

Inheritance & Method Overriding:

Both Viking and Saxon override receiveDamage() from Soldier.

This allows them to give different messages even though the logic (subtract health) is similar.

Polymorphism:

The attack() method works the same way for Vikings and Saxons (from Soldier).

But receiveDamage() behaves differently depending on whether it’s a Viking or Saxon.

Encapsulation:

Each object manages its own health and strength.

You don’t directly manipulate those values outside the class except through methods.

Randomness in Battle:

The random.choice() ensures unpredictability (different Viking/Saxon fights each turn).
